Assignment #0
=============

For this class, you will turn in work via assignment folders committed 
to a repo, instead of e-mailing them or uploading them to a server. 
Create a new folder for each assignment, and place all the files for 
that assignment inside, with an ``index.html`` file that I can load to 
see your work. Do not create a new repo each time, and do not place 
them in folders at random or in existing folders, because then I won't 
be able to find them.

You should also not store multiple copies of your assignments in the 
folder (say, for backup purposes). I should not see more than one 
``index.html`` file in each folder, and preferably there should only be 
one ``.js`` file as well. Don't worry about backups or starting 
over--for this class, I'll teach you how to use Git and GitHub to 
commit your work at significant points, instead of manually managing 
multiple files.
